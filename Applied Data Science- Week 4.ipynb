Living in such multicultural place restaurant recommendation seems quite helpful. In such scenarios, we need to find the right place, at reasonable cost, to serve us the best possible way. So there are few questions that must be addressed, such as :\n1. How many types of foods are available in the restaurant ?\n2. Which is the most nearest to me with good rating ?\n3. How many \"similar\" restaurants are available near by me ?\n4. Do the \"similar\" restaurants cost more ? if so, what speciality do that have ?\n\nTo address such question, XXYZ company's manager decides to allocate this project to me not just to find out solutions to the questions but also build a system that can help in recommending new places based on their rankings compared to the previously visited by me.\nExpectations from this recommender system is to get answer for the questions, and in such a way that it uncovers all the perspective of managing recommendations. It is sighted to show :\n\n1. What types of restaurants are present in a particular area ?\n2. where are the similar restaurant present based on a preference to particular food ?\n3. How do different restaurants rank with respect to my preferences ?"

People could simply decide to look for a similar restaurant all the time because they are addicted to a specific category of food. People who rarely use restaurants would prefer to have the most rated restaurants nearby them and all this could be easily handed by our recommender system. So target for this project is basically everyone who is exploring different places or similar places."
